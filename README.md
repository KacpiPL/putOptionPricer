## Project Overview

Welcome to the project putOptionPricer - this is ready-to-build .Rcpp package which contains getPutPrice() function to calculate the theoretical value of **put down and out option** using Monte Carlo Simulation.

I highly encourage you to see the short report from the simulation [here](https://rpubs.com/KacpiPL/MC_Simulation_Option).
